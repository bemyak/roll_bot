# DungeonBot
Build status: [![build status](https://gitlab.com/bemyak/roll_bot/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/bemyak/roll-bot/commits/master)

Telegram Bot for D&D 5e players.

Implemented features:
- [X] Roll a die
- [ ] Search for spell reference
- [ ] Search for monster reference
- [ ] Search for items reference

## Before launch
The only thing needed to get the bot running is to set `ROLL_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable. You can obtain this token from the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

## Is it even legal?
This projects doesn't host any data, everything is fetched from https://5e.tools public API, so all legal questions should be addressed there.
